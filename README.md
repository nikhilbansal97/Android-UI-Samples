# Android UI Samples
The aim is to maintain a central repository that hosts animations/feature implementations in live production apps so that others know how to do it.

### Contribution
You can fork this repository and start contributing to it. Some guidelines are established so that the maintainenance of the repository is easier:
1. Add the complete android project in the root directory of this repository.
2. Clean the project before the commit.
3. include any tutorials/Medium articles that might have helped you in re-creating the feature.
4. It can be a small animation that you've seen in some production app, a complete functionality, inspiration from UpLabs, Dribble etc.
5. Include a README.md file with screenshots/video to showcase what you've created.
6. It would be best if the code is in Kotlin.
